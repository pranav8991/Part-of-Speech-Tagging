# Part of Speech Tagging: The Epic Saga of Syntax and Semantics 🚀

## Welcome to the Project! 🎉

Greetings, brave coder! In this quest, you shall wield the Pomegranate library (yes, it’s as sweet as it sounds) to construct a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Part of Speech (POS) tagging. Prepare for a journey where accuracy reigns supreme and tagging prowess shall be your badge of honor! 🏅

## Project Introduction 🧐

In this notebook, we shall embark on a linguistic adventure, utilizing a universal tagset to achieve >96% tag accuracy! Hidden Markov Models have not only conquered the realm of tagging but have also been champions in speech recognition, machine translation, and even human gesture recognition! It's time to add your name to this illustrious list! 📜✨

### Tasks Overview ⚔️

Your path is laid before you, with sections clearly marked for your heroic deeds. The notebook provides a sturdy foundation, and all you need to do is sprinkle your coding magic where indicated. Remember, sections that begin with 'IMPLEMENTATION' are where you must shine!

### Note: The Warm-Up 🥵

Before you dive headfirst into the main saga, tackle the optional warm-up exercise! Launch the *HMM warmup (optional).ipynb* file to get familiar with the Pomegranate API. It’s like stretching before a marathon—your muscles will thank you!

## Criteria: The Final Boss Fight 💪

To conquer this project, you must complete sections 1 to 3. Section 4 is optional for those who desire further glory. Your reviewer awaits, ready to evaluate your triumph against the project rubric.

## How I Survived the Project 🛡️

### Step 1: The Beginning of the End 🚀

We kick things off by reviewing our interface to load and access the text corpus. This is where the magic starts—gathering your words like a wizard collecting spells!

### Step 2: Setting Up the Environment 🌍

You have two paths to choose from:

- **Workspace Method**: Use the pre-configured workspace in the classroom. Open the lesson, tackle the sections in the Jupyter notebook, and hit "submit project" when you’re done!

- **Local Method**: Download the project materials and set up a Jupyter server on your machine. Follow the README like a treasure map!

### Step 3: Implementing the Most Frequent Class (MFC) Tagger 📊

We need a trusty baseline—time to implement the MFC tagger! Here’s how:

1. **Pair Counts**: Implement the `pair_counts()` function. Count those tags like a prospector counting gold nuggets! 🪙
2. **MFC Baseline**: Make sure your MFC tagger meets the accuracy thresholds of >95.5% on training sentences and 93% on test sentences. 

### Step 4: Heuristic Implementation with HMM 🎩

With the baseline set, it’s time for the pièce de résistance:

1. **Unigram and Bigram Counts**: Gather your counts like a hoarder! `unigram_counts()` and `bigram_counts()` are your best friends here.
2. **HMM Construction**: Build your HMM tagger, ensuring accuracy >97% on training sentences and >95.5% on test sentences. This is where you become the master of tagging! 🧙‍♂️

### Step 5: Experiments & Results 🔬

Run your taggers on complex datasets, such as the `nltk.corpus.brown` or `nltk.corpus.treebank` datasets. Test those hypotheses and watch the results roll in! 🧪

### Step 6: Graphing My Sanity 📈

Visualize your findings with delightful graphs. If your sanity remains intact after this, you deserve a medal! 🏅

## Project Submission Instructions 📦

Once your coding feats are complete, finalize your work by exporting the iPython Notebook as an HTML document. Run all code cells to ensure reviewers see the glorious outputs. Follow these steps:

1. **Export**: Go to File -> Download as -> HTML (.html).
2. **Zip It Up**: Add the `hmm tagger.ipynb` and `hmm tagger.html` files to a zip archive.
3. **Submit**: Hit that submission button and await your reviewer’s accolades! 🎉

## How to Run This Masterpiece 🏗️

To run this enchanting creation, follow the steps outlined above in "Getting Started." Choose your preferred method, ensure your environment is set up, and execute the cells like the coding wizard you are! 🧙‍♀️

## Conclusion 🏁

Congratulations! You’ve navigated the labyrinth of Part of Speech Tagging with style, humor, and flair. Your journey has not only refined your coding skills but also expanded your knowledge of HMMs and their magical capabilities.

##Just remember — even the mightiest programmers start with baby steps (and occasional tantrums). And hey, sometimes those baby steps mean seeking help from fellow coders, dissecting their code, and piecing together solutions. So yes, I’ve had my fair share of peeking into others' projects, learning from their work, and figuring out how things tick. It’s all part of the journey. So, maff kar do muja if I borrowed an idea or two along the way—because, in the end, it’s about growing and improving. 😅
